- Beginning with our work, first of all we took help from the internet in understanding the process of downloading both **virtual box** and **debian 12** and we did it as below:-
  1. We went to chrome or any browser that we preferrably use
  2. Typed virtual box download in the search br and then clicked search
  3. Then we selected the topmost link saying **ORACLE VM VIRTUAL BOX**
  4. After that its website opened and then we clicked the very first link
  5. It then led us to a downloading window and after that the virtual box got downloaded in the downloads section of our pc
